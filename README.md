# Cohort-Retension-Analysis

 Here I explored an online retail dataset and created a retention cohort analysis in SQL and visualized it Tableau
 
 I carried out these exercises in this project:
 • Handled missing values
 • Month extraction from date
 • Assign cohort to each transaction
 • Assigning cohort Index to each transaction
 • Create cohort table for retention rate
 • Visualize the cohort table using Tableau which is in my tableau public
 • Interpretation of the retention rate
